## Brown Noise Player

This repository includes a simple brown noise generator with a small GUI for
real-time playback. The application requires `sounddevice` and `tkinter`.

### Running

```bash
pip install sounddevice numpy
python brown_noise_player.py
```

Move the volume slider to adjust the output level. Use the **Start** and
**Stop** buttons to control playback.
